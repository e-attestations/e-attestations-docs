## 🎉 Yes we did it !  🎉

🚀 EDGE is Live with a new Postman EDGE API documentation !

<!--truncate-->

L'Atelier by e-Attestations is very proud to annonce that EDGE is live since a few days now. 

We invite you to discover also the Postman Documentation website.

It provides a interactive production with automated code samples aside of the even richer Postman requests collection.

Check them out !

And you can still find our documentations format as well :

- Redoc : [https://e-attestations.io/openapi/redoc.html](https://e-attestations.io/openapi/redoc.html)


And as always, more is coming 😁
