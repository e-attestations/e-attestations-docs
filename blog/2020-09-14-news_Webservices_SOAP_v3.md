e-Attestations WebServices SOAP v3 now implements the DUNS for two major functionalities :

- Importing a thirdparty and create a new dossiers
- Retreiving dossiers' thirdparty based on the DUNS

Check out the new version of our WebService SOAP v3 documentation for more details.

No breaking change ! Just use 'CIT003' as CompanyIDType if you have a DUNS and you're good to go.
