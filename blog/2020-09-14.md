e-Attestations WebServices SOAP v3 now implements the DUNS for two major functionalities :

- Importing a thirdparty and create a new dossiers
- Retreiving dossiers' thirdparty based on the DUNS

If you don't know what is DUNS : [https://www.dnb.com/ca-fr/duns-number.html](https://www.dnb.com/ca-fr/duns-number.html)

Check out the new version of our WebService SOAP v3 documentation for more details.

No breaking change ! Just use 'CIT003' as CompanyIDType if you have a DUNS and your good to go.

> This new feature will be available (with a lot more) in API EDGE very soon ! Stay tune.com...

And as always, more is comming 😁
