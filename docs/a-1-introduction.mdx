The REST / Json API is used to **interface** a **client** application or information system with the e-Attestations platform following the HTTP protocol.

REST (Representational State Transfer) or RESTful is an architectural style allowing to build applications (Web, Intranet, Web Service) by exploiting endpoints (endpoints urls) and referencing resources to be exploited according to the verbs of the HTTP protocol ( GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc ...).

**Client** applications using the e-Attestations REST API enrich the Client Information System with the catalog of e-Attestations data and services in a secure and very flexible manner.

The API can also be used by software integrators, editors, SAAS APIs, connectors etc.
