***e-Attestations API EDGE*** is a RESTful / Json API used to **interface** a **client** application or information system with the e-Attestations platform following the HTTP protocol.

REST (Representational State Transfer) or RESTful is an architectural style allowing to build applications (Web, Intranet, Web Service) by exploiting endpoints (endpoints urls) and referencing resources to be exploited according to the verbs of the HTTP protocol ( GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc ...).

**Client** applications using the e-Attestations REST API enrich the Client Information System with the catalog of e-Attestations data and services in a secure and very flexible manner.

The API can also be used by software integrators, editors, SAAS APIs, connectors etc.

Why 'EDGE' ?

Because at e-Attestations we've been using ***a LOT of APIs*** for more than 10 years for our solutions and we know how APIs are powerful solutions.

We want to offer to our customers' developers and our partners the best experience possible with our new ***evergreening*** RESTful API
by delivering the last ***cutting EDGE version*** of e-Attestations' data and processes without any breaking change and with the best tooling ever.
