This resource is the ordering customer and service subscriber to e-Attestations account.

The account identifier is returned in the `account_ids` returned in the JWT token.

In addition, you can also retrieve your account identifier from the `/account` endpoint without any parameters.

All requests must include the customer identifier so that every time the account's activation and subscription to the service are verified

`/account/<your_account_id_goes_here>`

You can store your account identifier in your configuration sets or choose to retrieve it dynamically.
The latter solution being the most flexible.
