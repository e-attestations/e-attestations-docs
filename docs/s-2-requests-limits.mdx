## Anti DDOS mecanism

Our API manage many requests and serves them very fast. 

Even so, in order to avoid overflowing or DDOS attacks we developped a mecanism that limits, per client, the number of possible request per seconds.

This mesure leverages performance on a 'natural' limit for a great number of requests for all our customers without major pitfall.

### How it works ?

Its quite silmple : each account requesting the API is limited to 20 requests per second.

If this limit is reached the corresponding client, it will be authorized to overconsumes once to 10 more requests in the following seconds (burst mode), 
then the licent will have to wait 1 more second before being able to request again.

In that case will receive an `HTTP 429 Too many requests`.

You can check this metrics on limits in the header that are sent back with the reponse.

```sh

* Connection state changed (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS == 128)!
< HTTP/2 200
< [...]
< content-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
< x-ratelimit-remaining: 19
< x-ratelimit-burst-capacity: 20
< x-ratelimit-replenish-rate: 10

```

header|description
------|-------------------
x-ratelimit-remaining| Number of remainging requests within the second
x-ratelimit-burst-capacity| The allowed burst capacity 
x-ratelimit-replenish-rate| The replenish number of requests allowed after everloading  in the next second
