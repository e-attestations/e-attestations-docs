To subscribe to one or other of the environments, you must first **send your request to your usual e-Attestations account manager**.

We advise you to discuss the configuration for your account concerning compliance documents with your account manager in order to fully understand your use case and advise you best.

**Warning**: The use of the API is not multi-account.

Your account manager will inform the technical team for the creation of an organization linked to your account and one or more technical contacts (emails) will then be invited to the **Tech'Desk e-Attestations**.

## Tech'Desk e-Attestations support

It's the **TECHNICAL** ticketing and support system dedicated to APIs in which you can post questions and requests.

After receiving an invitation email, create your user and password independently to access the services and documentation of this support platform.
