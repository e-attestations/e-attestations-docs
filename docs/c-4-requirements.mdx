Requirements are resource related to a set of requests in the business area of ​​the client (legal, compliance, business, etc.).

As part of the continuous monitoring of third party compliance, a requirement is materialized in the workflow by a requested evidence ('document') and awaiting a response.

In most case response has already been provided by thirdparty or e-Attestations.

This response is most often provided by e-Attestations, which catalogs and aggregates the responses from numerous data sources from various administrations and trusted data providers.

The answer can also be given by the thirdparty himself in several cases:

- a file with a required document
- entering specific data
- one or more documents and their linked file(s)
- a dated and auditable electronic signature
- any other element requested constituting proof of compliance in the context of monitoring.
