## Identifier type

An establishment or a company (in the legal person sense) is identified in the e-Attestations system using a national identifier code (SIRET, SIREN for France) or an international number (eg VAT identifier ).

e-Attestations APIs offer two types of identifiers for Thirdparties

Code    |Type|Country|Description
--------|----|----------|------------------------
CIT001  |SIRET|France|Identifier used in France to qualify establishments. Number of 14 digits verifying Luhn's algorithm [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formule_de_Luhn)
CIT002  |TVA|CEE|Identifier used by the EEC for companies subject to corporation tax. More information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT_identification_number)

New types of identifiers may be implemented as the API evolves.

## Completeness indicator

e-Attestations completeness indicator provides simple information that the third party has fully covered the requirements for compliance required by client compliance.

Example: a third party surveillance file is considered complete for the "due diligence" indicator, if all the documents relating to the due diligence are present and validated.
