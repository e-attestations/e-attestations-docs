## Company Identifier types

An establishment or a company (in the legal person sense) is identified in the e-Attestations system using a national identifier code :

- The SIRET for French companies
- The TVA for EU companies (but french)
- The DUNS (Dun & Bradstreet identifier) for any company


thus, e-Attestations EDGE API offers several types of company identifiers :

Code    |Type|Country|Description
--------|----|----------|------------------------
CIT001  |SIRET|France|Identifier used in France to qualify establishments. Number of 14 digits verifying Luhn's algorithm [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formule_de_Luhn)
CIT002  |TVA|CEE|Identifier used by the EEC for companies subject to corporation tax. More information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT_identification_number)
CIT003  |DUNS|Any|Dun & BradStreet identifier used as an international and owned by the customer. More information on [D&B](https://www.dnb.com/ca-fr/duns-number.html) website

New types of identifiers will be implemented in the future as the API evolves.

## Indicators

e-Attestations indicators provide customer with information
that the third party has fully covered and andswer the compliancy (and requirements) for **all 'dossiers'**.

The main completeness indicator is the "due diligence" indicator, 
which is "true" if all the documents relating to the due diligence are present and valid.
