To go even faster and facilitate the exploration and the implementation of our EDGE API and exploration of our API we provide you with a pretty huge Postman collection that you can find  [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3000526/TVKD3xcz)

You can explore many scenarios and use cases to functionally understand the infinite possibilities.


We invite you to use both of following resources : 

- [Postman collection documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3000526/TVKD3xcz)


Base on our OpenApi v3 specifications you will find also the provided documentation within our Postman team resource center :

## Using Postman 'environnement'

When you use Postman collection, we advise you to use environnement which is a set of variables.

To use this test suite, you'll have to set :

- username
- password
- ea_auth_serv
- ea_api_serv

## Install Postman

You can download Postman via <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/"> this link </a> or use newman via <a href = "https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman "> this link </a>.

You can also use [newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) for automatic testing, like we do :-)

```shell
npx newman run "eAttestations-API-REST-multi-version.postman_collection.json" \
  --global-var username="<user>" \
  --global-var password="<password>" \
  --global-var ea_auth_serv="https://auth.test-e-attestations.com" \
